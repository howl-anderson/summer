## Application Questionnaire

1. What would you like to gain from "Summer 2021"?

    'Summer 2021' is a strong appeal of the development of summer camp activities, able to bring together the country's outstanding student developers. The Wechaty community needs young blood to join, and I believe that with their participation, the Wechaty community will have a rapid development.

    Several students from the Wechaty community have become contributors during the 'Summer 2020' event, while three students have entered Wechaty Summer Admin. It is believed that more outstanding students will join the Wechaty community at this year's event, bringing more possibilities.

2. What would your org consider to be a successful summer? (New contributors, new features completed, more code written, better being able to guide new developers into open source world, etc.)

    For students:
      - Skilled use of community-related tool chains
      - Be familiar with the community's code specifications and develop good coding habits

    For the community:
      - More active student developers who become contributors
      - Optimising existing problems in the community
      - Implement new features to the community

3. How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?
This year, 21 potential mentors agreed to participate in mentoring different projects, as detailed:<https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-code/issues>

4. How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?
  In order for students to learn more and maintain high-frequency interaction between mentors and students, we have the following programs:
    - The Student should submit a weekly report to give the tutor control of the student's weekly workload.
    - Mentors should review each line of student code and give their own advice.
    - Mentors should discuss solutions with students in the issue list and are open to the entire open source community.
    - Students can also review the tutor's code to enhance the student's sense of accomplishment.
  In addition, our Admin team this year is made up of outstanding mentors and students from Summer 2020, who are experienced contributors who coordinate their exchanges with students and are confident that they will be able to achieve good results

5. How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?
The community will establish medium-term, closing goals, complete checks of all project completion rates by the deadline, and provide corresponding encouragements and reminders. If some students do not complete the project due to non-subjective wishes, a special discussion meeting between the tutor and the student will be arranged, and Wechaty Admin will track the progress.

6. Have your community ever participated om "Summer 2020"?  Yes

    - How many students did your community accept for 2020?
    11
