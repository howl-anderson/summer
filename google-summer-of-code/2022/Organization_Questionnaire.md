## Why does your organization want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

GSoC has attracted many contributors to open source projects like Wechaty. Through GSoC, we hope to let contributors understand Wechaty, improve Wechaty, and actually use Wechaty to complete some projects that are very valuable to the society. In this way, we can realize the vision of Wechaty: our technology makes society better.

## What would your organization consider to be a successful GSoC program?

Most projects are completed successfully. Contributors are happy to work on their projects and are more than willing to recommend them to classmates, friends or colleagues. Our projects can have long-lasting benefits to the community as well as to society.

##  How will you keep mentors engaged with their GSoC contributors? 

Our mentors are core members of the community. They have a rich history of contribution and experience, and a strong team spirit to trust each other. On top of that, we have established some management rules to ensure the success of the projects: we use email as the main communication channel and hold Zoom meetings when necessary. To monitor the entire process, we will meet once a week to discuss GSoC so that issues can be identified early. Each contributor will have at least two mentors to avoid the problem of disappearing mentors. In addition, the GSoC administrator will oversee the entire program.

##  How will you keep your GSoC contributors on schedule to complete their projects? 

Our GSoC administrators (some are also mentors) will track the progress of each project at a higher level. We use GitHub for code management so we can easily monitor progress by Issues and PRs.

In order to be selected, contributors need to complete an basic task from GitHub. This requires them to build and start looking at the code, which makes contributors more confident about future tasks, and our mentors also have the opportunity to understand how contributors work.

All contributors are required to submit progress reports on the GitHub issues under their projects every week, and to submit/update GitHub Issues/PRs every week. This will help find difficulties before the contributor is really lost.

##  How will you get your GSoC contributors involved in your community during GSoC? 

In the contributor program, we encourage contributors to participate in discussions on email and Zoom, creating their own open-source project or post blogs to share their thoughts about our project.

Our mentors will encourage contributors to introduce their ideas to the community to get involved. We believe that contributors need to do more than just write code. They need to interact with the community by proposing solutions and iterating the projejcts until they are good enough.
